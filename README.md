## Project Description

### Brief

I was tasked with developing an API that will help customers shop product of my store through an online environment.
This system will manage customer account information for any transactions with any products sold through the store. 
Each store has a number of customers dependent on store to customer location. These customers are allowed to shop the
store without an account. However, to purchase any product from the store an account must exist. Furthermore, 
each store has a dedicated admin account. This admin account allows for stock updates and store order history of the 
attached store. Combined with customer search of all customers.
